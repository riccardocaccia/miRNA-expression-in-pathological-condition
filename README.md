# miRNA expression in pathological condition

Exploratory and statistical analysis of miRNA expression levels under different biological and pathological conditions.
Project designed and aimed at practicing in a realistic bioinformatics context.

## Objectives

- Loading and cleaning miRNA expression data
- Differential expression
- Clustering and size reduction
- Clear and interactive visualizations
- In-depth analysis of the Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn libraries

## Dataset

'date/'
It contains real or simulated miRNA expression data (e.g. from NCBI GEO or created with 'numpy').

## Requirements

Install the packages:

'''bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
